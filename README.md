# Personal-Portfolio

Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed 
projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

## User Story

AS AN employer <br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples <br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position <br>

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs: <br>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio <br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them <br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation <br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section <br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work <br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications <br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application <br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others <br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications <br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application <br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices <br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport <br>
